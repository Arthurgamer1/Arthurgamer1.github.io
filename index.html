            <p> Just your average computer scientist. Definitively not a leader, and definitively a very shy person.
                That's why he is definitevely not doing something esle while you guys are having a meeting with the
                Vice-President. I'm also not looking forward to see your opnions on how she did.

                <br><br>
                But yeah guys this is just an example, for a website. I'm sure some of you know HTML but these
                are the basics,
                we will move to something more advanced later. When I'm not super shy to be with you in the meeting.
                hehe
